# Carbonite

Carbonite is a tool for creating aesthetically pleasing images of source code that [eventually] integrates with standard productivity suites (such as Microsoft Office or GSuite) for simple and efficient inserting and updating of source code into your documents and presentations.

It is inspired by [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh).
