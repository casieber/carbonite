# Monacarbon

Monacarbon is a tool for creating aesthetically pleasing images of source code that [eventually] integrates with standard productivity suites (such as Microsoft Office or GSuite) for simple and efficient inserting and updating of source code into your documents and presentations.

It is inspired by the [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh), with the primary difference being the editor running under the hood. Carbon uses the [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) editor, while Monacarbon uses the [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) editor.
